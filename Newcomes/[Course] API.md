### **CONCEPT OF API AND RESTFUL**
> 1st week: What's the API?
1. Something about API. and How to used it?
> APIs are software intermediaries that facilitate communication between different applications.
```
APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are software intermediaries that enable two applications to communicate with each other. APIs allow developers to access specific functionalities of an application or service without needing to understand how it works under the hood.

2. Restful api - Schemas and Method.
> RESTful APIs use HTTP requests and standard methods to manipulate resources, and schemas define the structure of exchanged data.
```
RESTful APIs are a set of guidelines for creating web services that use HTTP requests to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data. They use a resource-based URL scheme and standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources. Schemas are used to define the structure of data exchanged between clients and servers.

3. Swagger Editor
> Swagger Editor is an open-source tool for designing and documenting RESTful APIs in the OpenAPI specification format, using a visual and code editor.
```
Swagger Editor is an open-source tool for designing and documenting RESTful APIs. It allows developers to create API descriptions in the OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specification format, which can be used to generate documentation, server stubs, and client SDKs. Swagger Editor provides a visual editor and code editor to help developers create and edit API descriptions.

### **DESIGN API**
> 2nd week: Fast API 


1. About the Fast API
> A brief introduction to the FastAPI Python web framework and its features.
```
FastAPI is a modern, fast (hence the name), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It provides high performance and intuitive APIs for developers, and is designed to be easy to use, maintainable, and scalable. One of the main features of FastAPI is its automatic data validation, which uses Python's type annotations to validate input data and generate accurate API documentation. Other notable features include support for asynchronous programming, automatic generation of OpenAPI and JSON schema documentation, and built-in support for OAuth2 authentication.
```


2. Create API By FastAPI / POST AND GET
> Creating an API with FastAPI: A step-by-step guide to creating a simple API using FastAPI and Python, with both POST and GET endpoints.
```
In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a simple API using FastAPI and Python. We will start by installing the required dependencies and setting up a basic project structure. Then, we will define our API endpoints, including both POST and GET requests, and use FastAPI's automatic data validation to ensure that our data is formatted correctly. Finally, we will test our API using the FastAPI built-in web server.
```



3. Postman
> Using Postman with FastAPI: How to test and interact with your FastAPI endpoints using the Postman API development tool.
```
Postman is a popular API development tool that allows developers to test and interact with APIs. In this tutorial, we will show you how to use Postman with your FastAPI endpoints to make HTTP requests, set up environment variables, and more. We will start by creating a new Postman project and adding our FastAPI endpoints as requests. Then, we will configure our requests to include any necessary headers, query parameters, or request bodies. Finally, we will run our requests and view the responses in the Postman console.
```

### **SHARING SERVICE**
> 3rd week: share you api
1. maintain an API service
2. maintain an API service with docker/ docker-compose
3. maintain an API service on GCP/ Azure/ AWS

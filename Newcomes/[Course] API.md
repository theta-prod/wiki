### **Concept of API and Restful API**
> 1st week: What's the API?
1. something about API.
2. How to used it?
3. restful api introduction.

1. Topic: Schemas and Methods in Programming

Schemas and methods are essential concepts in programming that help developers to define and organize data structures and behavior in their applications. A schema is a blueprint or definition of a data structure, while a method is a procedure or function that performs a specific task or action on that data structure. Schemas and methods are used in many programming paradigms, including object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming. Understanding schemas and methods can help developers create more efficient, maintainable, and scalable applications.
Summary: Schemas and methods are important programming concepts that help organize data structures and behavior in applications.


Topic: Designing APIs with Swagger

Swagger is a popular tool used by developers to design and document APIs. It allows developers to define the structure and behavior of an API in a machine-readable format, making it easier for developers to understand and use the API. With Swagger, developers can define endpoints, request and response schemas, authentication methods, and more. Swagger also provides a user-friendly interface for testing and exploring APIs. By using Swagger to design APIs, developers can improve the usability and reliability of their applications.
Summary: Swagger is a tool used to design and document APIs, helping developers to improve the usability and reliability of their applications.



Topic: Implementing a Swagger API

Once an API has been designed using Swagger, it can be implemented using a variety of programming languages and frameworks. Swagger provides a range of code generators that can generate client and server code in many programming languages, including Java, Python, and Ruby. This makes it easy for developers to create fully functional APIs that are compliant with the original design. Implementing a Swagger API involves configuring the server environment, generating the code, and testing the API to ensure that it behaves as expected.
Summary: Implementing a Swagger API involves configuring the server environment, generating code, and testing the API to ensure compliance with the original design.


### **Design API**
> 2nd week: Design API 
1. schemas and method
2. Design API By Swagger
3. Implement Swagger API

Topic Name: Understanding API Operations


API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for software applications to communicate with each other. It allows developers to access and use a range of services provided by a software platform. In this topic, we'll explore the fundamentals of API operations, including the different types of APIs, how they work, and how they are used. We'll also discuss API design, documentation, and best practices for implementing and testing APIs.
Summary: Understanding the basics of API operations, including types, design, and best practices.

Topic Name: Cloud Computing Platforms - GCP, Azure, AWS
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, including storage, processing power, and applications. Three of the most popular cloud computing platforms are GCP (Google Cloud Platform), Azure (Microsoft Azure), and AWS (Amazon Web Services). In this topic, we'll explore the features and benefits of each platform, as well as their differences and similarities. We'll also look at use cases and deployment scenarios for each platform.
Summary: Comparing and contrasting the features and benefits of GCP, Azure, and AWS cloud computing platforms.




Topic Name: Introduction to Docker and Docker Compose

Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to package, deploy, and run applications in a containerized environment. Docker Compose is a tool that allows developers to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. In this topic, we'll explore the fundamentals of Docker and Docker Compose, including containerization, image creation, and deployment. We'll also look at use cases and best practices for working with Docker and Docker Compose.
Summary: Understanding the basics of Docker and Docker Compose, including containerization, image

Topic: API Operations

Introduction: This class will cover the basics of API operations, including what APIs are, how they work, and how to use them. We'll also explore different types of APIs and the various tools and technologies used in API development and management.
Summary: Learn about APIs, their functions, and development tools.



Topic: API Operations on GCP/Azure/AWS

Introduction: This class will focus on API operations in cloud environments, specifically on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). We'll cover topics such as API gateways, serverless architectures, and API management services offered by these cloud providers.
Summary: Explore API operations in GCP, Azure, and AWS.



Topic: API Operations by Docker/Docker-compose

Introduction: This class will cover how to deploy and manage APIs using containerization technologies such as Docker and Docker Compose. We'll explore the benefits of using containers for API operations, how to create API images, and how to deploy and orchestrate API containers.
Summary: Learn how to use Docker and Docker Compose for API operations.
